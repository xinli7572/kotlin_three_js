# Kotlin Three.js

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23aba91b-c7ed-4c8d-b94e-4f79024045a9

This project demonstrates how to use Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics, with Kotlin. It allows you to create 3D scenes, objects, and animations using Kotlin/JS (Kotlin JavaScript) that run in the browser.

## Features

- **3D Graphics Rendering**: Utilizes Three.js for rendering 3D objects in the browser.
- **Kotlin/JS**: Leverages Kotlin to write JavaScript code for the web.
- **Interactive 3D Scene**: Users can interact with the 3D objects via mouse and touch events.
- **Dynamic Object Creation**: Easily create and manipulate 3D models, lights, and cameras.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xinli7572/kotlin_three_js.git
```

###  2. Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA
To work with this project, open the directory in IntelliJ IDEA. Itâ€™s recommended to have Kotlin plugin installed for seamless development.

### 3. Build and Run
To build and run the project, follow these steps:

- Ensure that you have Node.js installed.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
### 4. Run the project with:

```bash
npm run start
```
This will start a local server and open the project in your web browser. You should now see the 3D scene rendered in the browser.

## Code Overview
### Kotlin Entry Point
The main logic is in the Kotlin files where we set up the Three.js scene, including objects, lights, cameras, and rendering.

### Three.js Integration
Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in the browser. In this project, Kotlin is used to write the code, which is then compiled into JavaScript.

### Example 3D Scene
The default scene includes a rotating cube with basic camera and light setup. You can interact with the scene and see how the 3D objects behave as you move your mouse or use touch gestures.

### Technologies Used
Kotlin/JS: A version of Kotlin that compiles to JavaScript for browser-based applications.
Three.js: A JavaScript 3D library used to create and render interactive 3D graphics in the browser.
Webpack: A static module bundler used for bundling and serving the project.
